This demo is based on [https://github.com/cprinos/glitch-fastapi](https://github.com/cprinos/glitch-fastapi).

Highlights:
- `main.py` defines a web application using FastAPI
- `glitch.json` help Glitch know how to setup and run this project using non-standard web server
- `requirements.txt` defines software requirements (just `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for now)
- `static/index.html` is a bit of static content showing how to write client-side code that interacts with our server code
